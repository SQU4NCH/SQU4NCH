I'm a pentester specialist with experience in Web Hacking, Web API Security, and Mobile Exploitation. I'm a low-level programming and exploit development enthusiast, and I have been improving my skills in this area over the last years.

Outside of work, I like to play CTF and participate in conferences like H2HC, BSides, etc...

I have a Degree in Cyber Defense, and currently I'm doing a master's degree in Computer Science at the Federal Technological University of Paraná (UTFPR). I also hold some security certifications, such as eWPTX, eMAPT, eJPT, Pentest+, DCPT, SCMPA, and SCWAP.
